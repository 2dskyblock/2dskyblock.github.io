        <h1>2D Skyblock Tutorial</h1>
        <p><a href="https://2dskyblock.github.io">Back</a></p>
        <p>You start on a tiny island in the middle of nothingness. You have a few items and a lone tree. To succeed, you must be smart with your resources, like using “ǥ” wisely. Learn the basics, complete challenges, and grow. Don't worry if you make mistakes and have to start over—it's part of the learning process!</p>
        <p>Here you are! You have arrived, and this should be the first thing you see:</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/1.png" width=100%>
        <p>It’s fine if the tree and the arrows are a bit different on your screen—it doesn’t matter too much.</p>
        <p>First up, right click sections of the tree. You should receive 3 upright logs, a few saplings, and a stick if you’re lucky.</p>
        <p>You can right click some saplings onto the grass, and they will eventually grow into new trees. Trees will only grow if they’re surrounded by grass, so you should preserve your current setting.</p>
        <p>Once you’re done, you can right click the block between the blue arrows.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/2.png" width=100%>
        <p>
            After clicking it, it should drop 1x dirt. The block will regenerate after a short period of time. This special block is called the generator
            <br>
            Note: If you’re holding a block while clicking the block between the arrows, you may place down the block you’re holding. This will cause the generator to stop working.
        </p>
        <p>Occasionally, you may obtain 1ǥ while mining. Once you obtain 1ǥ, then you should click crafting in the bottom right, and go to the “nature” tab and craft your upright logs into wooden planks.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/3.png" width=100%>
        <p>Once you’ve did that, you want convert 2x wooden planks to 4x sticks by clicking the location shown below:</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/4.png" width=100%>
        <p>It is advised to only click it once, as you still need planks in the future.</p>
        <p>After you finish that, you should click the “tools” tab and craft a wooden pickaxe.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/5.png" width=100%>
        <p>You can now go back to the main menu.</p>
        <p>Remember the ǥ you found earlier? Go to the generator tab.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/6.png" width=100%>
        <p>After clicking “Generator”, you should be at this place:</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/7.png" width=100%>
        <p>
            If you’re there, great! Now what you want to do is buy the upper caves.
            <br>
            Since the ID of the upper caves is 2, click buy. When the prompt asking you to enter ID appears, enter 2.
            <br>
            After that, click select, and enter 2 in the prompt.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now this is where the wooden pickaxe comes into play. Using just your fist, you can’t pick up such an object. 
            <br>
            However, once you use your wooden pickaxe to mine the stone, you can pick up the item.
        </p>
        <p>Once you get 3x raw copper, go to the crafting tab once again. After a bit of searching in the stone tab, you should be able to find the trade of 1x coal for 8x fuel. Click craft.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/8.png" width=100%>
        <p>After you’ve gotten some fuel, go to the smelting tab and convert 1x raw copper and 1x fuel for a copper ingot. Repeat this process 3 times.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/9.png" width=100%>
        <p>Go to the tools tab and craft yourself a copper pickaxe. You should now be able to mine iron and obtain raw iron. While mining, you should go sell some stone, granite, andesite, diorite—anything that won’t help you much.</p>
        <p>Whatever you want to sell should be at the top of your inventory, as shown.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/10.png" width=100%>
        <p>To actually sell something, you can click sell all (if you want to sell all of it) or sell (if you want to sell one of it).</p>
        <p>After selling things, you should receive some money. That money can be used in the shop.</p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/11.png" width=100%>
        <p>
            In the shop, you can buy many things, like growth rate, new layers to explore, food, the avatar, and more.
            <br>
            If you want to buy something, you can buy it using its ID.
            <br>
            For instance, if I wanted to buy 1ǥ, then I would click “buy item” and enter its ID (10) when the prompt appears.
        </p>
        <img src="https://2dskyblock.github.io/assets/tutorial/12.png" width=100%>
        <p>There are an incredible array of biomes and habitats waiting to be explored, each with their own unique wonders and treasures to discover! From lush forests to sprawling deserts, from icy tundras to vibrant coral reefs, the possibilities are boundless. And let's not forget about the vast collection of exotic artifacts just waiting to be unearthed, each one holding the potential for untold adventures and fascinating stories. Get ready to embark on an exhilarating journey of exploration and marvel at the endless wonders that await!</p>
