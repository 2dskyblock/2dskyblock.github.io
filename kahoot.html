    <p>You are on the island of knights and knaves. Knights always tell the truth, and knaves always lie.</p>
    <p>You meet 3 people: Alice, Bob, and Carol. They each say something:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Alice says that Bob is a knave.</li>
      <li>Bob says that Alice tells the truth.</li>
      <li>Carol says that Bob is a knave, and if not, that she is a knave.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Are they knights or knaves?</p>
